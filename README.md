### Hello!

Hi! Iâ€™m a 3rd-year undergraduate computer science and mathematics (statistics) student at the [University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/). I work as a casual software developer, as well as a maths tutor / teaching assistant. In addition, I am currently the secretary of the [UQ Computing Society](https://uqcs.org/), and industry liaison of the [Mathematics Students Society, UQ](https://www.facebook.com/uqmss/).

I have very broad interests from many different areas of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and elsewhere. My current interests include:

- machine learning, especially its statistical aspects;
- front-end web development;
- algorithms and theoretical computer science;
- graphic design and typography.
