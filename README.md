### Hello!

Hi there! I’m a 4th-year undergraduate computer science and mathematics (major in statistics) student at the [University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/). I work as a casual software developer at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/), as well as a maths tutor/teaching assistant in the [School of Mathematics and Physics](https://smp.uq.edu.au/), and a research assistant in the [Transcription Acceleration Project](https://www.itee.uq.edu.au/research/projects/tap) at the ARC Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language ([CoEDL](https://www.dynamicsoflanguage.edu.au/)). In addition, I’m currently president of the [Mathematics Students Society, UQ](https://www.facebook.com/uqmss/), and a member of the executive committee (formerly secretary) of the [UQ Computing Society](https://uqcs.org/).

Currently, I’m interested in:

- machine learning, especially its statistical aspects;
- algorithms and competitive programming;
- full-stack web development;
- pure mathematics;
- graphic design and typography.
